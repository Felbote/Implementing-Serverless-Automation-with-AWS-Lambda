Role Name: LambdaS3ResizeRole

Trusted Entity: AWS Lambda
Description: This IAM role allows AWS Lambda functions to interact with S3 buckets and write logs to CloudWatch.

Attached Policies:
1. AmazonS3FullAccess
   - Grants full access to S3 buckets.
   - In production, consider using a more restrictive custom policy that limits access to specific buckets only.

2. AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
   - Provides permissions for Lambda to write logs to CloudWatch.

Purpose:
- Enable the Lambda function 'my-image-processor' to:
  * Read from the source bucket (your-blog-original-uploads)
  * Write to the destination bucket (your-blog-public-assets)
  * Log processing information and errors to CloudWatch

Trust Relationship:

  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- For security best practices, avoid using AmazonS3FullAccess in production.
- Instead, create a custom policy granting access only to the required buckets.
